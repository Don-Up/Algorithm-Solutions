# [Factorial Trailing Zeroes](https://leetcode.cn/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)

Given an integer `n`, return *the number of trailing zeroes in* `n!`.

Note that `n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`.

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: n = 3
> Output: 0
> Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: n = 5
> Output: 1
> Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: n = 0
> Output: 0
> ```

## Solution Approach

To calculate the count of trailing zeros in a factorial result, we don't have to calculate the entire factorial value. Trailing zeros are generated by the factor 10, which is derived from multiplying factors 2 and 5. In a factorial, the count of factor 2 is always greater than the count of factor 5; hence, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of factor 5.

### Steps

1. Initialize `count` to 0 to record the count of factor 5.
2. Use a loop, divide `n` by 5 each time, accumulate quotients into `count`.
3. Continue the loop until `n` is less than 5.

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var trailingZeroes = function(n) {
    let count = 0
    while(n >=5){
        n = Math.floor(n/5)
        count += n
    }
    return count
}
```
