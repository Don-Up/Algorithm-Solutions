# 73. implement Observable fromEvent()

This is a follow-up on [57. create an Observable](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Observable).

Suppose you have solved [57. create an Observable](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Observable), here you are asked to implement a creation operator `fromEvent()`( for DOM Event)

From the [document](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/function/fromEvent), `fromEvent()`

> Creates an Observable that emits events of a specific type coming from the given event target.

Simply speaking, it is a util to attach event listener in Observable fashion.

```js
const source = fromEvent(node, 'click')source.subscribe((e) => console.log(e))
```

When `node` is clicked, the event is logged.

**Note**

1. Observable is already given for you, no need to create it.
2. the event listener removal is handled by [add()](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/class/Subscription#add), which is beyond our scope here, you can ignore that.



## Solution

```js
const source = fromEvent(node, 'click')
source.subscribe((e) => console.log(e))
```

```js
// Example usage:
// 1. element: a DOM node (such as a button)
// 2. eventName: 'click'
// 3. capture: optional boolean, defaults to false
function fromEvent(element, eventName, capture = false) {
    
  // subscriber is passed as `(e) => console.log(e)`
  return new Observable((subscriber) => {
    // Event handler function
    const eventHandler = (event) => {
        // console.log(event)
        subscriber.next(event);
    }
    
    // Add event listener to the element
    element.addEventListener(eventName, eventHandler, capture);

    // Return an unsubscribe function to remove the event listener
    return () => {
      element.removeEventListener(eventName, eventHandler, capture);
    };
  });
}
```
