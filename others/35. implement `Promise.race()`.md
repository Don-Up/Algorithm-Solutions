# 35. implement `Promise.race()`

This problem is similar to [31. implement async helper - `race()`](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-async-helper-race), but with Promise.

> The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise. [source: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)

Can you create a `race()` which works the same as `Promise.race()`?

## Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Array<Promise>} promises
 * @return {Promise}
 */
function race(promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    promises.forEach(promise => {
      // We attach both resolve and reject handlers
      // to each promise in the array.
      Promise.resolve(promise).then(resolve, reject);
      // Promise.resolve(promise).then(resolve).catch(reject);
    });
  });
}
```
