# 50. search element right before target with Binary Search(possible duplicate array)

This is a variation of [37. implement Binary Search (unique)](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Binary-Search-Unique).

Your are given a sorted ascending array of number, but **might have duplicates**, you are asked to return the **element right before first appearance** of a target number.

If not found return `undefined`.

*note*

Please don't use `Array.prototype.indexOf()`, it is not our goal.

## Solution

To find the element right before the first appearance of a target number in a sorted array with possible duplicates, we can utilize a binary search approach. The main idea is to first find the first occurrence of the target and then return the element that is immediately before it.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr - ascending array with duplicates
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
function elementBefore(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  let result = -1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      result = mid;
      right = mid - 1; // Continue to search in the left half
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  if (result === -1 || result === 0) {
    return undefined; // Target not found or target is the first element
  } else {
    return arr[result - 1]; // Element right before the first occurrence of target
  }
}

// Example usage
console.log(elementBefore([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)); // Output: 1
console.log(elementBefore([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)); // Output: 2
console.log(elementBefore([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1)); // Output: undefined
console.log(elementBefore([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)); // Output: undefined
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` is initialized to the start of the array (`0`).
   - `right` is initialized to the end of the array (`arr.length - 1`).
   - `result` is initialized to `-1`, which will store the index of the first occurrence of the target if found.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

3. **Middle Calculation**:
   - `mid` is calculated as the floor of `(left + right) / 2`.

4. **Comparison**:
   - If `arr[mid]` is equal to the `target`, we update `result` to `mid` and continue searching in the left half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the `target`, we adjust `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the `target`, we adjust `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.

5. **Check Result**:
   - After exiting the loop, if `result` is `-1`, it means the target was not found in the array, so we return `undefined`.
   - If `result` is `0`, it means the target is the first element in the array, so there is no element before it, and we return `undefined`.
   - Otherwise, we return the element at `arr[result - 1]`, which is the element right before the first occurrence of the target.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log N)`, where `N` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we use a binary search.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
