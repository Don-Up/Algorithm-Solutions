# 121. A number sequence

Here is a sequence:

1. `'1'`, first number is 1
2. `'11'`, since previous number has One(1) 1
3. `'21'`, since previous number has Two(2) 1s
4. `'1211'`, since previous number has One(1) 2 and One(1) 1
5. `'111221'`, since previous number has One(1) 1, One(1) 2, Two(2) 1s
6. `'312211'`, since previous number has Three(3) 1s, Two(2) 2s, One(1) 1
7. ....

As explained above, the sequence is generated by counting the digits of previous number.

Please create `getNthNum(n)` to return the n-th number string in the sequence, n starts from 1.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence where each number describes the digits of the previous number in the sequence. This sequence is known as the "Count and Say" sequence. Let's implement the `getNthNum` function to generate the n-th number in this sequence.

### Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n - integer
 * @returns {string}
 */
function getNthNum(n) {
  if (n <= 0) return "";

  let current = "1"; // Start with the first number in the sequence

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    let next = "";
    let count = 1;

    for (let j = 1; j < current.length; j++) {
      if (current[j] === current[j - 1]) {
        count++;
      } else {
        next += count + current[j - 1];
        count = 1;
      }
    }

    // Append the last group
    next += count + current[current.length - 1];
    current = next;
  }

  return current;
}

// Test cases
console.log(getNthNum(1)); // '1'
console.log(getNthNum(2)); // '11'
console.log(getNthNum(3)); // '21'
console.log(getNthNum(4)); // '1211'
console.log(getNthNum(5)); // '111221'
console.log(getNthNum(6)); // '312211'
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Case**:
   - We start with `current = "1"` for the first element of the sequence.

2. **Iterative Generation**:
   - For each step from 1 to n-1 (since we already have the first number), we generate the next number in the sequence based on the current number.
   - We use two variables: `count` to keep track of the number of consecutive identical digits and `next` to build the next number in the sequence.

3. **Counting and Building**:
   - We iterate through the `current` string, counting consecutive identical digits.
   - When the sequence of identical digits ends, we append the count followed by the digit to the `next` string.
   - We continue this until we process the entire `current` string.

4. **Updating the Sequence**:
   - After constructing the `next` string for the current iteration, we update `current` with `next` and repeat the process.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After completing the loop, `current` contains the n-th number in the sequence, which we return.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where n is the number of sequences to generate and m is the maximum length of a sequence. The length of the sequence grows exponentially, but since we only perform operations proportional to the length of the sequence, the overall time complexity is O(n * m).
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the length of the longest sequence, as we need to store the current and next sequences.

This implementation effectively generates the n-th number in the "Count and Say" sequence.
