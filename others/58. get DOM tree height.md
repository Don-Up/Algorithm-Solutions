# 58. get DOM tree height

Height of a tree is the maximum depth from root node. Empty root node have a height of 0.

If given DOM tree, can you create a function to get the height of it?

For the DOM tree below, we have a height of 4.

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <button>Hello</button>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    <span>World!</span>
  </p>
</div>
```

Can you solve this both recursively and iteratively?

## Solution

To determine the height of a DOM tree, we need to find the maximum depth from the root node to any leaf node. The height of an empty tree (or a tree with a null root) is considered 0.

### Recursive Solution

The recursive approach involves the following steps:
1. If the node has no children, its height is 1 (the node itself).
2. For each child, recursively calculate the height of the subtree rooted at that child.
3. The height of the node is 1 plus the maximum height among all its children.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement | null} tree
 * @return {number}
 */
function getHeight(tree) {
  if (!tree) return 0;

  let maxDepth = 0;

  for (let child of tree.children) {
    maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, getHeight(child));
  }

  return maxDepth + 1;
}
```

### Iterative Solution

The iterative approach uses a queue (for breadth-first traversal) to track nodes and their corresponding depths. We can maintain a maximum depth variable and update it as we encounter nodes.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement | null} tree
 * @return {number}
 */
function getHeight(tree) {
  if (!tree) return 0;

  let maxDepth = 0;
  const queue = [{ node: tree, depth: 1 }];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const { node, depth } = queue.shift();
    maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, depth);

    for (let child of node.children) {
      queue.push({ node: child, depth: depth + 1 });
    }
  }

  return maxDepth;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Recursive Solution**:
   - **Base Case**: If the node is null, return 0.
   - **Recursive Case**: For each child, compute its height and keep track of the maximum. Return 1 plus the maximum height of the children.

2. **Iterative Solution**:
   - **Initialization**: Start with the root node at depth 1. Use a queue to facilitate breadth-first traversal.
   - **Processing**: For each node, update the maximum depth if the current depth is greater. Add all children of the current node to the queue with an incremented depth.
   - **Result**: The maximum depth encountered during the traversal is the height of the DOM tree.

### Time Complexity

Both the recursive and iterative approaches visit each node exactly once:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the DOM tree.

### Space Complexity

- **Recursive Solution**: \(O(h)\) where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to the call stack.
- **Iterative Solution**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of nodes, due to the queue.

Both solutions effectively compute the height of a DOM tree. The iterative solution might be preferred in environments where deep recursion could lead to a stack overflow.
