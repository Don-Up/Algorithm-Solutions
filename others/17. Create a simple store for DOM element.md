# 17. Create a simple store for DOM element

We have `Map` in es6, so we could use any data as key, such as DOM element.

```js
const map = new Map()
map.set(domNode, somedata)
```

What if we need to support old JavaScript env like es5, how would you create your own Node Store as above?

You are asked to implement a Node Store, which supports DOM element as key.

```js
class NodeStore {
  set(node, value) {
  }
  
  get(node) {
  }
  
  has(node) {
  }
}
```

*note*

Map is disabled when judging your code, it is against the goal of practicing.

You can create a simple general Map polyfill. Or since you are asked to support specially for DOM element, what is special about DOM element?

What is the Time / Space cost of your solution?

## Solution

### Custom Node Store Implementation

To create a `NodeStore` that supports DOM elements as keys in environments without ES6 `Map`, we can leverage the fact that DOM elements are unique objects. One approach is to use a `WeakMap` polyfill if memory efficiency and automatic garbage collection are important. However, since `WeakMap` is also an ES6 feature, we'll use a regular object for simplicity, associating each DOM element with a unique identifier.

**Key Concept:**
DOM elements have a `dataset` property, which can be used to store custom data attributes. We can utilize this to store a unique ID for each node.

#### Implementation:

```javascript
class NodeStore {
  constructor() {
    // Initializes an empty object `store` to hold the node-value pairs.
    this.store = {};
    // `nodeId` is used to generate unique identifiers for each DOM element.
    this.nodeId = 0;
  }

  _getNodeId(node) {
    // Checks if the DOM element already has a unique identifier. 
    if (!node.dataset.nodeId) {
      // If not, it assigns one using the `dataset` property.
      node.dataset.nodeId = ++this.nodeId;
    }
    return node.dataset.nodeId;
  }

  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @param {any} value
   */
  set(node, value) {
    // Associates the DOM element with a value by storing the value in `store` using the element's unique identifier.
    const id = this._getNodeId(node);
    this.store[id] = value;
  }

  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @return {any}
   */
  get(node) {
    // Retrieves the value associated with the DOM element using its unique identifier.
    const id = node.dataset.nodeId;
    return id ? this.store[id] : undefined;
  }

  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @return {Boolean}
   */
  has(node) {
    // Checks if a value is associated with the DOM element by looking up its unique identifier in the `store`.
    const id = node.dataset.nodeId;
    return id in this.store;
  }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - `set`: `O(1)`
  - `get`: `O(1)`
  - `has`: `O(1)`

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of unique DOM elements stored, as each element's value and a reference to the element are stored in the `store` object.
