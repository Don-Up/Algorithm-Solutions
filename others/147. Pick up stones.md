# 147. Pick up stones

There is a pile of `n` (n > 0) stones.

Player A and Player B take turns to pick 1 or 2 stones from the pile. A starts first.

Who picks the last stone loses the game.

Now here is the question, **is there a winning strategy for A or B ?** If so, returns the player name. If there is none, return null.

```js
winningStonePicking(1)
// 'B'
winningStonePicking(2)
// 'A'
winningStonePicking(3)
// 'A'
winningStonePicking(4)
// 'B'
```



## Solution Approach

To determine the winner in the stone-picking game, we need to analyze the game dynamics based on the rules:

1. Players can pick either 1 or 2 stones from the pile.
2. The player who picks the last stone loses the game.

We can solve this problem by considering each possible state of the game and determining whether the current player can force a win based on the remaining number of stones.

### Key Observations:

- If a player leaves exactly one stone for the opponent, the opponent will be forced to pick the last stone and lose. Therefore, the current player wins.

### Solution:

To decide whether Player A (starting player) has a winning strategy, we can iterate over the number of stones and deduce the winning condition based on the remaining stones after Player A's turn.

- **Winning Configuration:** If there is a configuration in which the opponent is forced into a losing position regardless of their choice, then the current player is in a winning position.

Let's implement the function `canWinStonePicking`:

```javascript
function canWinStonePicking(n: number): 'A' | 'B' | null {
  // Initialize an array to keep track of winning states, dp[i] is true if the starting player can force a win with i stones left
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);

  // Base cases:
  // dp[1] = false, because picking the last stone means losing
  // dp[2] = true, because picking one stone leaves the opponent with one stone, and they lose by picking the last stone
  dp[1] = false;
  if (n >= 2) dp[2] = true;

  // Fill dp array
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = !dp[i - 1] || !dp[i - 2];
  }

  // If dp[n] is true, A has a winning strategy
  return dp[n] ? 'A' : 'B';
}

// Test cases
console.log(canWinStonePicking(1)); // 'B'
console.log(canWinStonePicking(2)); // 'A'
console.log(canWinStonePicking(3)); // 'A'
console.log(canWinStonePicking(4)); // 'B'
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - `dp[i]` indicates whether the player whose turn it is can force a win with `i` stones remaining.
   - `dp[1]` is initialized to `false` because if only one stone is left, the player picking the last stone loses.
   - `dp[2]` is initialized to `true` because the starting player can pick one stone and force the opponent to pick the last stone, losing the game.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - For each `i` from 3 to `n`, `dp[i]` is set to `true` if the player can force a loss for the opponent. This happens if either of the resulting states after picking 1 or 2 stones leads to a losing state for the opponent (i.e., `dp[i - 1]` or `dp[i - 2]` is `false`).

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The result is determined by the value of `dp[n]`. If `dp[n]` is `true`, Player A (the starting player) has a winning strategy. If `dp[n]` is `false`, Player B wins.

This solution uses dynamic programming to determine the outcome efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).
