# 47. reverse a linked list

Another basic algorithm even for Front End developers.

You are asked to **reverse a linked list**.

Suppose we have Node interface like this

```js
class Node {
   new(val: number, next: Node);
   val: number
   next: Node
}
```

We can then chain nodes together to create a linked list.

```js
const Three = new Node(3, null)
const Two = new Node(2, Three)
const One = new Node(1, Two)
//now we have  a linked list
// 1 → 2 → 3
```

Now how can you reverse it to 3 → 2 → 1 ? you can modify the `next` property of each node, but not the `val`.

Could you solve it with and without recursion?

## Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Node} list
 * @return {Node} 
 */
const reverseLinkedList = (list) => {
    // Create a new list with list.val as the head and null as the tail node.
    let newList = new Node(list.val, null);

    // While list.next exists.
    while (list.next) {
        // Extend newList by prepending a new head node.
        newList = new Node(list.next.val, newList);
        // Move the pointer to the next node of list.
        list = list.next;
    }

    return newList;
}
```
