# 66. remove duplicates from an array

Given an array containing all kinds of data, please implement a function `deduplicate()` to remove the duplicates.

You should modify the array in place. Order doesn't matter.

> What is time & space cost of your approach?

## Solution

To deduplicate an array containing all kinds of data, we can use a set to keep track of the unique elements we've encountered. Since sets automatically handle duplicates, they are a convenient choice for this task. We then iterate through the array, adding elements to the set if they haven't been encountered before, and modifying the array in place.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {any[]} arr
 * ðŸ’¡[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'a', 2, 1, { x: 1 }, { x: 1 }];
 */
function deduplicate(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  let writeIndex = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (!seen.has(arr[i])) {
      seen.add(arr[i]);
      arr[writeIndex] = arr[i];
      writeIndex++;
    }
  }

  // Remove extra elements beyond writeIndex
  arr.length = writeIndex;
}

// Example usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'a', 2, 1, { x: 1 }, { x: 1 }];
deduplicate(arr);
console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', { x: 1 }]
```

### Explanation

1. **Set for Tracking Seen Elements**:
   - We use a `Set` called `seen` to store the elements that have already been encountered. Since sets in JavaScript automatically handle duplicates, they help us track unique elements efficiently.

2. **In-place Modification**:
   - We use a variable `writeIndex` to keep track of where to write the next unique element in the array. Initially, it's set to 0.
   - As we iterate through the array, if the current element (`arr[i]`) is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and place it at the `writeIndex` position in the array. We then increment `writeIndex`.

3. **Trimming the Array**:
   - After the loop, `writeIndex` will point to the position after the last unique element in the modified array. We set `arr.length` to `writeIndex` to remove the trailing elements, effectively resizing the array to contain only the unique elements.

### Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate through the array once (`O(n)`), and both checking if an element is in a set and adding an element to a set are \(O(1)\) operations on average.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We use a `Set` to store unique elements, which in the worst case could store all elements from the array, resulting in a space complexity of \(O(n)\).

This approach efficiently removes duplicates from the array while modifying it in place and maintains a time complexity of \(O(n)\) due to the efficient operations of the set. The order of the elements in the resulting array does not matter, as specified in the problem statement.
