# 96. count "1" in binary form

Given an integer, count "1" in its binary form.

```js
countOne(1) // 1,  "1"
countOne(257799) // 12, "111110111100000111"
```

1. If you use built-in string methods in JavaScript, please do understand the time complexity, they are not free.
2. Actually this could be easily done by counting the digit one by one. Could you think of some other approaches?

## Solution

To count the number of "1" bits in the binary representation of an integer, we can use different approaches. Here's the implementation using bitwise operations, which is efficient and doesn't rely on converting the number to a string:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num - integer
 * @return {number} count of 1 bit
 */
function countOne(num) {
  let count = 0;

  while (num !== 0) {
    // Use bitwise AND to check if the least significant bit is 1
    if (num & 1) {
      count++;
    }
    // Right shift the number by 1 bit
    num >>>= 1;
  }

  return count;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - A counter `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of "1" bits.

2. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**:
   - The expression `num & 1` checks if the least significant bit (LSB) of `num` is 1. If it is, `count` is incremented.

3. **Right Shift (`>>>=`)**:
   - The expression `num >>>= 1` right shifts the bits of `num` by one position. This effectively divides `num` by 2 and discards the least significant bit. The unsigned right shift (`>>>`) is used to ensure that the shift is logical and not arithmetic, treating the number as an unsigned integer and shifting in zeroes.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0, at which point all bits have been processed.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the integer input. This is because we are shifting the bits of the number one by one until the number becomes 0. The number of shifts corresponds to the number of bits required to represent the number, which is proportional to \(\log n\).

### Other Approaches

- **String Conversion**: Convert the number to its binary string representation and count the "1" characters. While simple, this approach can be less efficient due to the conversion process.
  
- **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm**: This algorithm can be used to count the number of set bits in a binary number. It works by repeatedly flipping the least significant set bit to 0 and counting how many times this operation can be performed until the number becomes 0. The complexity is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of set bits (1s). Here's a brief outline:

  ```javascript
  function countOne(num) {
    let count = 0;
    while (num !== 0) {
      num &= (num - 1);
      count++;
    }
    return count;
  }
  ```

This solution using bitwise operations is efficient and avoids the overhead of converting the number to a string representation.
