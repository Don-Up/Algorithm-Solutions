# 44. implement Selection Sort

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

## Solution

**Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. The main idea behind the selection sort is to divide the list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part is empty, and the unsorted part contains all the elements. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

Here's how you can implement selection sort:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 */
function selectionSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    // Assume the minimum is the first element
    let minIndex = i;

    // Check the elements to find the minimum
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
        minIndex = j;
      }
    }

    // Swap the found minimum element with the first element
    if (minIndex !== i) {
      [arr[i], arr[minIndex]] = [arr[minIndex], arr[i]];
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11];
selectionSort(arr);
console.log(arr); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

### Explanation

1. **Outer Loop**:
   - Runs from the start to the second-to-last element. This loop represents the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array.

2. **Finding the Minimum**:
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, assume the first element of the unsorted part (`arr[i]`) is the minimum (`minIndex = i`).
   - An inner loop scans the remaining elements (`arr[j]`) to find the actual minimum value in the unsorted part. If a smaller element is found, update `minIndex`.

3. **Swapping**:
   - After finding the minimum element in the unsorted part, swap it with the first element of the unsorted part (`arr[i]`). This moves the minimum element to the end of the sorted part.

4. **In-Place Sorting**:
   - The sorting is done in place, meaning no additional array is used. The original array is modified.

### Time Complexity

- **Best, Average, and Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\)
  - Regardless of the initial order of the elements, the algorithm always performs \(O(n^2)\) comparisons because it repeatedly searches for the minimum element and then swaps it.

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require extra space for another array.

### Stability

- **Stability**: Selection sort is **not stable**.
  - A sorting algorithm is considered stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements. In selection sort, even if two elements are equal, they may be swapped based on their position, potentially altering their relative order.

In summary, selection sort is easy to understand and implement but is inefficient for large lists due to its \(O(n^2)\) time complexity. It is not a stable sorting algorithm. It can be used in situations where memory space is a concern, as it has a space complexity of \(O(1)\).
