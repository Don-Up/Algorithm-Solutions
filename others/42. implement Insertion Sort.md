# 42. implement Insertion Sort

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?



## Solution

**Insertion Sort** is another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort. However, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data.

Here's the implementation of insertion sort:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 */
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let key = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;

    // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,
    // to one position ahead of their current position
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = key;
  }
}

// Example usage
const arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6];
insertionSort(arr);
console.log(arr); // Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
```

### Explanation

1. **Outer Loop**:
   - Starts from the second element (`i = 1`) and iterates through the array.

2. **Key Element**:
   - `key` stores the value of the element at index `i` that we want to insert into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop iterates backward from the element before `key` (at index `i - 1`) down to the beginning of the array. It shifts each element one position to the right until it finds the correct position for `key`.

4. **Insertion**:
   - Once the correct position is found, `key` is placed at `arr[j + 1]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: \(O(n)\)
  - The best case occurs when the array is already sorted. In this case, the inner loop runs only once for each element, resulting in a linear time complexity.

- **Average and Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\)
  - In the worst case, the array is sorted in reverse order. The inner loop runs for all preceding elements for each element, resulting in quadratic time complexity.

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires a constant amount of extra space.

### Stability

- **Stability**: Insertion sort is **stable**.
  - A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e., values).

Insertion sort is efficient for small arrays and partially sorted arrays. Its \(O(n^2)\) time complexity makes it inefficient for large datasets, but its simplicity and efficiency on small or nearly sorted data make it useful in certain situations.
