# 8. can you shuffle() an array?

How would you implement a shuffle() ?

When passed with an array, it should modify the array inline to generate a randomly picked permutation/ˌpɜːrmjuˈteɪʃn/ at the same probability.

for an array like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

there would be possibly 4! = 24 permutations

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 4, 3]
[1, 3, 2, 4]
[1, 3, 4, 2]
[1, 4, 2, 3]
[1, 4, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 3, 4]
[2, 1, 4, 3]
[2, 3, 1, 4]
[2, 3, 4, 1]
[2, 4, 1, 3]
[2, 4, 3, 1]
[3, 1, 2, 4]
[3, 1, 4, 2]
[3, 2, 1, 4]
[3, 2, 4, 1]
[3, 4, 1, 2]
[3, 4, 2, 1]
[4, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 1, 3, 2]
[4, 2, 1, 3]
[4, 2, 3, 1]
[4, 3, 1, 2]
[4, 3, 2, 1]
```

your `shuffle()` should transform the array in one of the above array, at the same 1/24 probability.

*notes*

Your `shuffle()` will be called multiple times, to calculate the probability on each possible result, and test again [standard deviation](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)

## Solution

To implement a shuffle function that modifies the array in place and ensures that each permutation is equally likely, we can use the **Fisher-Yates (or Knuth) Shuffle Algorithm**. This algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time complexity and ensures that each of the \(n!\) permutations is equally likely.

### Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm

1. **Iterate from the last element to the second element**:
   - For each element, pick a random element from the remaining unshuffled portion (including the current element) and swap them.

2. **In-place Modification**:
   - The swapping happens in place, ensuring that we don't need additional space beyond a few variables for the loop and swapping.

### Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {any[]} arr
 * @returns {void}
 */
function shuffle(arr) {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    // Pick a random index from 0 to i
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    
    // Swap arr[i] with the element at random index
    [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
  }
}

// Example usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
shuffle(arr);
console.log(arr); // Output: shuffled array
```

### Explanation

1. **Loop from the End to the Beginning**:
   - The loop starts from the last element (`arr.length - 1`) and goes down to the second element (`i = 1`).

2. **Random Index Calculation**:
   - For each element at index `i`, a random index `j` is selected such that `0 <= j <= i`.

3. **Swapping**:
   - The elements at indices `i` and `j` are swapped. This ensures that each element has an equal chance of ending up in any position in the array.

4. **In-place Operation**:
   - The shuffle is performed in place, modifying the original array without using extra space, aside from a few temporary variables.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The algorithm only requires one pass through the array, hence the linear time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - It only uses a few extra variables, making it a constant space solution.

The Fisher-Yates algorithm guarantees that each permutation is equally likely, which means it provides a fair shuffle. This is essential for applications such as games, simulations, or scenarios requiring unbiased randomization.
