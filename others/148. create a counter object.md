# 148. create a counter object

Create an object with property `count`, which increments every time `count` is accessed, initial value is 0.

```js
const counter = createCounter()
counter.count // 0, then it should increment
counter.count // 1
counter.count // 2
counter.count = 100 // it cannot be altered
counter.count // 3
```



## Solution Approach

To create an object with a `count` property that increments every time it is accessed and cannot be altered, we can use a closure to maintain the internal count state and `Object.defineProperty` to define the `count` property with a custom getter.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let internalCount = 0;

  return Object.defineProperty({}, 'count', {
    get() {
      return internalCount++;
    },
    set() {
      // Do nothing to prevent alteration
    },
    configurable: false,
    enumerable: true
  });
}

// Example usage:
const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.count); // 0
console.log(counter.count); // 1
console.log(counter.count); // 2
counter.count = 100; // Attempt to alter the count
console.log(counter.count); // 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Internal State**:
   - `internalCount` is a variable defined within the closure of the `createCounter` function. It keeps track of the count and starts at 0.

2. **`Object.defineProperty`**:
   - We use `Object.defineProperty` to define the `count` property on an empty object. This allows us to create a custom getter and prevent direct modification.

3. **Getter Function**:
   - The `get` method is used to define a custom getter for the `count` property. Each time `counter.count` is accessed, `internalCount` is returned and then incremented.

4. **Setter Function**:
   - The `set` method is defined but does nothing, effectively preventing any alteration to `internalCount` via the `count` property. 

5. **Property Configuration**:
   - `configurable: false` ensures that the property cannot be deleted or reconfigured.
   - `enumerable: true` makes the property visible during enumeration (e.g., `for...in` loops).

This implementation ensures that every time the `count` property is accessed, it returns the current count and then increments it, while also preventing any external modifications to the count value.
