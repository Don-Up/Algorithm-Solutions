# 120. create `isPrime()`

A [Prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1, such as 2,3,5....

You are asked to implement `isPrime()` to check if a number is prime.

What is the time cost of your implementation ? can you improve your approach to have the fewest comparisons?

## Solution

To implement the `isPrime` function, we need to determine whether a given number is prime. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Approach

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `num` is less than 2, it is not a prime number.

2. **Divisibility Check**:
   - For any number `num`, if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, then it is not a prime number.
   - We only need to check for divisors up to the square root of `num` because if `num` can be factored into two factors `a` and `b`, then one of the factors must be less than or equal to the square root of `num`.

3. **Optimizations**:
   - Numbers greater than 2 that are even are not prime, so we can skip even numbers after checking for 2.
   - Starting from 3, we can increment the divisor by 2 to skip even numbers.

### Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num - positive integer
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function isPrime(num) {
  if (num <= 1) return false; // Numbers less than 2 are not prime
  if (num === 2) return true; // 2 is the only even prime number
  if (num % 2 === 0) return false; // Other even numbers are not prime

  // Check for factors from 3 up to the square root of num
  for (let i = 3; i * i <= num; i += 2) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false; // Found a divisor, not a prime number
    }
  }

  return true; // No divisors found, num is prime
}

// Example usage
console.log(isPrime(2)); // true
console.log(isPrime(3)); // true
console.log(isPrime(4)); // false
console.log(isPrime(29)); // true
console.log(isPrime(1)); // false
console.log(isPrime(0)); // false
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases**:
   - Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
   - 2 is a prime number, but other even numbers are not, so we handle these cases early.

2. **Divisibility Check**:
   - We iterate from 3 up to the square root of `num`, checking only odd numbers (`i += 2`), as all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm runs in \(O(\sqrt{n})\) time complexity, where \(n\) is the input number. This is because the loop only runs up to the square root of `num`, significantly reducing the number of checks compared to checking all numbers up to `num`.

### Follow-up Improvements

The current approach with time complexity \(O(\sqrt{n})\) is already efficient for checking the primality of numbers. However, for extremely large numbers, advanced algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test or AKS primality test can provide probabilistic or deterministic primality checks, respectively, with potentially fewer comparisons or faster execution. These methods are beyond basic implementation but are useful for specialized applications requiring prime checks for very large numbers.
