# 162. find the single integer

Given an array of integers, all integers appear twice except one integer, could you quickly target it ?

```js
const arr = [10, 2, 2 , 1, 0, 0, 10]
findSingle(arr) // 1
```

What is time & space cost of your approach ? Could you do better ?

## Solution Approach

To find the single integer that appears only once in an array where all other integers appear twice, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR operation has some useful properties:

1. \( a \oplus a = 0 \) (XOR-ing a number with itself results in 0)
2. \( a \oplus 0 = a \) (XOR-ing a number with 0 results in the number itself)
3. XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not affect the result.

Given these properties, if we XOR all the numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel out, leaving only the number that appears once.

### Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
function findSingle(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc ^ num, 0);
}
```

### Explanation:

- We use the `reduce` method to iterate over the array and apply the XOR operation (`^`) to each element with an accumulator (`acc`). The initial value of the accumulator is 0.
- As we iterate through the array, numbers that appear twice will cancel out, leaving only the single number that appears once.

### Time & Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We only use a constant amount of extra space for the accumulator.

### Efficiency:

This approach is optimal because:
- It has a linear time complexity, which is the best we can do for this problem since we need to inspect each element at least once.
- It has a constant space complexity, which means it doesn't require additional space proportional to the input size.

There is no need for a better approach in terms of time complexity, as O(n) is the most efficient possible for this problem.
