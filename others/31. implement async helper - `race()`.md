# 31. implement async helper - `race()`

This problem is related to [30. implement async helper - `parallel()`](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-async-helper-parallel).

You are asked to implement an async function helper, `race()` which works like [Promise.race()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race). Different from `parallel()` that waits for all functions to finish, `race()` will finish when any function is done or run into error.

All async functions have following interface

```js
type Callback = (error: Error, data: any) => void
type AsyncFunc = (
   callback: Callback,
   data: any
) => void
```

Your `race()` should **accept AsyncFunc array**, and return a new function which triggers its own callback when **any** async function is done or an error occurs.

Suppose we have an 3 async functions

```js
const async1 = (callback) => {
   setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 1), 300)
}
const async2 = (callback) => {
    setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 2), 100)
}
const async3 = (callback) => {
   setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 3), 200)
}
```

Your `race()` should be able to accomplish this

```js
const first = race(
  [
    async1,
    async2,
    async3
  ]
)
first((error, data) => {
   console.log(data) // 2, since 2 is the first to be given
}, 1)
```

When error occurs, only first error is passed down to the last. Later errors or data are ignored.

## Solution Approach

To implement the `race` function, which should mimic the behavior of `Promise.race()` using an array of asynchronous functions (`AsyncFunc`), we need to call these functions and ensure that the first to complete (either with a result or an error) triggers the callback.

Here is the implementation of the `race` function:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {AsyncFunc[]} funcs
 * @return {(callback: Callback) => void}
 */
function race(funcs) {
  // We use a closure to return the function takes callback and data.
  // 1. We should call the callback at proper timing to expose the first completion's error or result.
  // 2. The data should be passed into each completion.
  return function(callback, data) {
    // ensure that only the first completed function (either successful or failed) triggers the callback.
    let settled = false;

    funcs.forEach(func => {
	  // Param1 → callback: Callback {(error: Error, data: any) => void},
   	  // Param2 → data: any
      func((error, result) => {
        if (!settled) {
          settled = true;
          callback(error, result);
        }
      }, data);
    });
  };
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Settled Flag**:
   - We use a flag `settled` to ensure that only the first completed function (either successful or failed) triggers the callback. Once `settled` is set to `true`, subsequent completions are ignored.

2. **For Each Function**:
   - We iterate over each function in the `funcs` array and call it with a callback and the data provided. Each function, when called, will eventually call the provided callback with either an error or a result.

3. **Callback Handling**:
   - Inside the callback passed to each function, we check if `settled` is `false`. If so, we set `settled` to `true` and call the original `callback` with the error or result. This ensures that only the first function to complete triggers the callback.

### Example Usage

Given the example async functions:

```javascript
const async1 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 1), 300);
};
const async2 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 2), 100);
};
const async3 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 3), 200);
};

const first = race([async1, async2, async3]);
first((error, data) => {
  console.log(data); // Outputs 2, since async2 finishes first
}, 1);
```

### Notes

- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs, it will be passed to the callback, but only the first error or successful result is considered, similar to `Promise.race()`.
- **Concurrency**: The `race` function does not wait for all functions to complete; it returns as soon as the first one does. This behavior is crucial for efficiency, especially when dealing with potential long-running operations.

This implementation correctly handles the race condition, ensuring that only the first result (either success or failure) is considered.
